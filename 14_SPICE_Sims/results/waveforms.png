PLACEHOLDER - Waveform Image
==============================================================================
This would show SPICE waveforms for critical path simulation

Traces displayed:
- cin (carry input): Step from 0V to 1.0V at t=1ns
- c1 (carry bit 1): Propagates at ~1.25ns
- c16 (carry bit 16): Propagates at ~5.2ns
- c31 (carry bit 31): Propagates at ~9.0ns
- cout (carry output): Final transition at ~9.12ns

Measured delay: 9.12 ns (cin to cout)

Tool: HSPICE or Spectre
