==============================================================================
This file would contain raw simulation data in tool-specific format

Includes:
- Time points
- Voltage/current values for all nodes
- Measured delays
- Power consumption

Format: HSPICE .tr0/.ac0 or Spectre .raw
Size: Typically 10-100 MB for full design
