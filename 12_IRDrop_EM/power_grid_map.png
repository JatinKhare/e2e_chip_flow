PLACEHOLDER IMAGE - Power Grid Voltage Map
==============================================================================
This would be a color-coded heatmap showing voltage distribution across chip

Legend:
  Red:    Low voltage (high IR-drop)
  Yellow: Moderate
  Green:  Good voltage (minimal IR-drop)

Typical visualization shows core center with slightly lower voltage
due to distance from power pads, but within acceptable limits.

Tool: Ansys RedHawk or Cadence Voltus
